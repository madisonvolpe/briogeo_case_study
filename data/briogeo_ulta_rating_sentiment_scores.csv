When I rinsed it I was surprised how dry and stiff my hair felt. I did not feel it moisturized at all. I blow dried on low setting as I normally do after applying serum and smoother but my hair was so puffy and frizzy. I decided to flat iron and ended up passing through my whole head twice. It's pretty frizz free now after following up with oils, so I'm not sure if this is what one can expect from this product? I typically use Strength and Repair Mask from Shea Moisture which leaves it soft and more hydrated. So not impressed overall or am I missing something?!",0.109,0.092,0.799,0.6617

Usually, I have a fairly tight spiral curl throughout, but my hair is overall fine. I need something to hold my curls together without frizz to keep the curls intact. I keep my hair long, but I need the dead ends trimmed. 

I don't regularly use a hair masking product, but I got this in an Allure box for this February. After one use, my hair was shiny, and my curls were tighter than they've been in months. It felt like I had a trim at the salon.

My hair was very soft and bouncy, even with my usual styling products. My curls still held well despite how soft this product made my hair. I am very happy with the results and will use it again. The smell is pleasant but doesn't linger over my other styling products as well. I'll look into other hair repair masks too, since I have some other samples to try. I will compare them  to this one since it did so well.",0.135,0.031,0.834,0.9558

I used the product twice, so maybe since it was you need to use it three times before you get two times stronger hair I would need to get one more use to get there?  I liked that it felt thick going on my hair, not too watered down.  But I did not care or the smell, it was actually slightly unpleasant to me, I could not put my finger on it.

Warning to those following the Curly Girl/Guy Method or those using sulfate-free shampoo: This does contain isododecane, which is a wax that is NOT water soluble. Therefore, this will continue to build up in your hair without the use of sulfates.

I am looking to repair my somewhat damaged, color treated hair and also provide it necessary hydration. I usually use NYMs curl talk deep conditioning mask, which is amazing but I really liked the repairative aspect of this product so I decided to give it a shot. I purchased the small version of this since it's so expensive. The bigger version is $36 dollars or so and the smaller mini version was only $12. This isn't actually a great deal considering the oz you get and the purchase price. However, it was affordable enough just to give it a shot snd see if this is something I wanted to invest in. Hair is very important to me so if I find a product that works, I would like to buy it. This product is NOT it though. The mask itself is thick, white and has a very mild, light pleasant smell. It was really difficult to comb through my hair while it in shower. Usually masks make it super easy to finger comb and distribute product throughout but this made my hair feel very stiff. Once I rinsed it throughly and towel dried my hair, I felt the texture of my hair and it was so horrible. It felt like straw. Dry and brittle. It was so hard to comb through but the texture, ugh, the texture was so gross and dry. I had to immediately put leave in conditioner in my hair just to comb through it after using the mask. I won't be using this again. It did not live up to the hype and in fact, was super disappointing. I'll give two stars for the thickness, pleasant smell and accessibility of the mini size of the mask.

My hair also suffered from the damage effects of wigs and weaves by  splitting my hair cuticle and significantly thinning my hair.  I had significant thin patches and bald spots after my very last weave install. It was time that I took better care of my hair despite my busy schedule.   I cut off all of my hair and kept my ends well trimmed with a schedule.  In nine months at 47 yrs old my hair began to thicken and grow back but it was dry. The Briogeo package quickly addressed the dryness with the first treatment.  It deeply moistures and has an elongating effect on my hair type.  I absolutely love the oil also because it actually penetrates the hair shaft and does not just sit on my hair.  This is the only oil in my life that has been this effective.  Plus I love the fresh, light clean scent.  The products don't clash and interfere with your refined body parfume.

 Briogeo is also good for prepping for a silk press but I actually love how my hair curls at the end so I may rotate products and use this every other week as a damage control, hydrating treatment for fear of losing my beautiful curl pattern.

I was really looking forward to this product, as well as the dry shampoo I purchased (yet to try that). I'm holding off on whether I'd buy again from Briogeo based on how the dry shampoo goes, but it's not promising at the moment.

Good packaging, straightforward instructions, and a nice texture of the product on the fingers. However, we got off to a rocky start when there was a hair in the product upon opening it. Not the end of the world, easily removed, and the product was otherwise undamaged. It was, consequently, a well-moisturized hair. I withheld judgment on the company, because sometimes life happens. Still, not a great intro to a new company.

My biggest issue with this product is with the product itself. Goes on easily, like a normal conditioner would. It has a good texture in the hand and a nice subtle sent. HOWEVER, Does not come off easily. Rinsed for ages, and not only did it leave a film on my shower floor that I then had to rinse, but it feels very heavy and filmy on my hair. I was hoping it would feel better as it dried, but no luck. Definitely doesn't leave my fair feeling soft, but actually quite firm and stiff. I wouldn't buy this product again.

It isn't cheap but you really don't need much for it to work. You will definitely get better results the longer you leave this on. It doesn't have a ton of slip in comparison to other products, but once you let it sit and rinse you can feel it. If you are someone who is prone to protein overload, you don't want to use this too often, especially if you are not clarifying your hair often and using other hair products regularly with a lot of protein in them. I would guess that if you have processed hair, you'll have to worry less about this because your hair tends to lose protein and moisture more easily and therefore needs more of both to keep it strong & healthy. If this doesn't apply to you but you still want to use this often because you like the way your hair feels, my advice would be to limit the amount protein in your hair routine (don't eliminate), and avoid the Briogeo Curl Charisma line because of the amount of protein in those products. I know that makes no sense, but even though the products are good for your hair, they can cause protein overload quite easily for certain hair types.",0.14,0.077,0.783,0.9633

It smells nice but that doesn't mean anything when it doesn't do what it claims to at all! I will flat out spare you the time of reading if you'd like by saying that you won't be doing yourself any favors by buying this expensive garbage. If you want to know exactly why I feel this way, read on.
I had heard nothing but good things about this brand and while it's possible the other products are good, this one is terrible! (I also tried the shampoo with it beforehand and it wasn't anything to rave about either.)
I applied a good amount to my long hair and put a shower cap on. Left it on for about 15 minutes and when I rinsed, my hair felt coarse and brittle. I don't usually have such an issue with tangles but because I color treat my hair every once in a while, I am sure to do deep conditioning treatments on my hair once or twice a week, depending. I was out of my usual favorite and decided I wanted to try something different, what a mistake! I have naturally straight hair with a bit of a wave and it is on the thicker side so I always make sure to condition. I also rarely do any heat styling on my hair so it isn't immensely damaged. I get compliments on my hair by my stylist because it's usually in great condition. This actually made my hair much worse and drained it of any moisture I might have had.

I recommended it to my all my friends and family, and could have bought out every store that had this conditioner.

But when I recently bought a new jar, i could just tell something was off. It smelled differently, it looked not as thick. Then sure enough, as I put it on my hair..it had a consistency of watery lotion and my hair did not change at all after administration. In fact, my hair felt like straw, it was super tangled, and when I combed through my hair, it sounded like I was breaking my hair while combing. 
When I compared the new bottle to my old, empty one, the ingredients were indeed different.

I started using this twice a week and I leave it for as long as I can. For deeper conditioning, I cover it in plastic cap and hop in the sauna before rinsing. After a month of use, I can definitely see that my hair has improved and hydrated. It is healthier than ever and even shinier.

I am also so thrilled with the amazing customer service I have received as well. When my package was delivered one of the products came damaged. I emailed customer service with the issue and the next day I received a friendly email asking if it was okay if I could receive another replacement product. I felt like they truly listened to my issue and did everything they could to solve it. Not only did I receive one but I received two items of the ones that were damaged. I then received an email asking how the products were working for me. Wow! All of this in a month one span of time. Amazing! The person who emailed me was Allie Genesis. So if the company reads this review please give her credit for being so kind and helpful to me!

it's so easy to rinse out and doesn't leave any residue or buildup. I have an oily scalp and this didn't make my hair look oilier the next day. It just made my hair very soft, shiny, and overall healthier. I would highly recommend this if you have heat damaged hair like me.",0.142,0.042,0.815,0.953

She has naturally curly hair that leans towards frizz. Its so dry no matter what we do or use. We used it tonight. Her hair just seemed to soak it up. Rinsed after 5 minutes, and for the first time, we didn't need spray in conditioner. She has a mop of ringlets!",0.018,0.037,0.944,-0.3414

I've been using this product for less than two weeks and I absolutely love it.  It leaves my dry and somewhat frizzy hair soft and smooth to the touch.  Briogeo's Don't Despair Repair is exactly what my hair needs.",0.12,0.018,0.862,0.7754

This right here is top of the line, cream of the crop!! The jar is small but a little goes a long way, even for my really long hair which usually drinks up conditioner like none other. The smell is wonderful- lightly fruity and fresh. I love all the ingredients it contains but more especially what it doesn't contain- no silicones, sulfates or parabens. I use this alone, with my steamer or with heat and any way I get fantastic results! Minimal frizz, incredible shine, defined waves which feel very soft and that literally look like spun blonde silk. I can't rave about this mask enough- give it a try, you won't be sorry! I hope this comes out in a supersize soon.",0.211,0.037,0.752,0.9816

I have been combatting breakage for years given the color and chemical processing on my hair and this product has been a game changer.  Im surprised I haven't seen this in more stores yet.  Hopefully they are working on it!,0.11,0.0,0.89,0.7232
